# GroanDiceGame

Groan is a dice game that combines luck and judgment, providing an enjoyable gaming experience for two players. The objective is to reach an agreed total using a pair of dice. Players accumulate scores by rolling the dice and strategically deciding when to pass them to the opponent.

#Rules Overview
* Each player has a cumulative score and a running score.
* The active player rolls the dice, adding the numbers to the running score.
* If a player rolls a one on either die, they lose the running score, and the dice pass to the opponent.
* Players can choose to pass the dice to the opponent, adding the running score to their cumulative score.
* Rolling double ones results in losing both the running and cumulative scores.
* The game continues until one player reaches the goal score or higher.

#Features
* Set player names and choose a winning score limit between 50 and 100.
* Randomly determine the starting player.
* Display current player and running score during gameplay.
* Automatically determine the winner when a player reaches or exceeds the goal score.
